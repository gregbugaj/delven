  * Based on modern languages / frameworks (EcmaScript / TypeScript / Python / Rubby / SQL/ Node.js)
  * Web 2.0 and beyound (Support for extracting data from dynamic websites as well as realtime data extraction)
* Exposing low level API as first class citizens
  * Javascript
  * TypeScript
  * C++ navive extensions  
* Query plan
* Package Manager
  * Delven Package Manager(DPM)
  * Node Package Manager(NPM)
* Distributed Processing
