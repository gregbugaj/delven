Debuging Delven(CEF)

Delven engine is build with Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF), which is a framework for embedding Chromium-based browsers in other applications. You can take advantage of the Chrome Developer Tools to debug your scripts.


Remote debugging is enabled on port 9222, allowing CEF to be debugged from any CEF or Chrome browser window. 
To access the CEF remotely, go to the localhost URL oriented to the debugging port number: http://localhost:9222
